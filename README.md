# BankManager
I am progrmaming a Bank Manager using the text editor VS code.

# Reflection

## Introduction/Purpose:
I utilized a text editor called Visual Studio Code to build a bank manager program using the programming language java. The program will create new customers who are able to create a checking and savings account. All of their information along with there checking and savings balance will be stored in a text file. Moreover, existing customers are able to check their balance, deposit, and withdraw money from either account as well. This program taught me how to create text files in java, while also reading from the text files in order to check the balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. I also learned how to create methods in java which allowed me to create many helping methods that can be utilized multiple times throughout my program. Lastly, I learned how to program an arraylist and pass in information through methods and the arraylist.
